# Contributing

To keep this guide coherent here are a few guidelines:
- Sections and libraries must be sorted alphabetically.
- Descriptions should be a short sentence with proper punctiation.
- Descriptions and links must be separated by an en-dash (`–`), not a hyphen (`-`).
- Summary of changes could be described briefly in commit and pull request messages.

An example entry:
```
- [Om](https://github.com/omcljs/om) — A powerful interface to React, makes use of its object oriented structures.
```
